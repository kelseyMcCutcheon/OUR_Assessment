# OUR_Assessment

This project was created for our senior Capstone at Champlain College.

ABSTRACT: "We were dissatisfied with the way we, and many young adults around our age, take various standardised tests. With this in mind, we decided to create one of our own, but this time we wanted to put an emphasis on the students' experience and feedback. We decided to create a web based application appropriately titled OUR Assessment, designed by students, for students. It is a competency-based assessment intended to provide students with an unbiased assessment of their actual mathematics skills. The assessment will determine whether or not a student is considered ‘competent’ in a certain mathematical level. As well as give students useful and personalized information about what specific concepts they need to focus their efforts on."
